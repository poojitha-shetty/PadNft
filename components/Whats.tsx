            It is high time that we understood that Menstruation is a human issue and not only a womenâ€™s issue. 
            Equally important it is to understand that it concerns hygiene and is not a purity issue. 
            People need to know that menstrual blood is not impure.
             Just like blood from any other part of the body, once out, 
             this blood too starts decomposing and thus emanates an odor. During periods women are at greater risk of urinary tract infections due to dampness. Contrary to popular belief that women should avoid contact with water, women need to regularly wash with clean water, keep the area dry and change sanitary napkins or tampons every three to four hours to prevent growth of bacteria or fungus leading to infections. Use of unclean cloth or not changing the pad at regular intervals can lead to rashes and abrasions to the external genitalia in addition to increased susceptibility to infections. We also need to understand the significance of safe disposal of menstrual waste. People throw it in toilets causing them to choke and overflow. Many times people throw it away without properly covering it due to which dogs and other stray animals pick it up from the dustbins and litter the streets. We also need to switch to more eco-friendly ways of sanitary waste disposal and also appreciate innovations 
            in this area such as sanitary cups and bio-degradable napkins.
